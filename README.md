# Simple News ðŸ“°

## Overview:

Simple News is a basic application displaying news articles from the New York Times. This application is a take home challenge given during Mod 4 at Turing School of Software & Design that was completed over the duration of about 8 hours. The main goal of this project was to build a proof of concept and meet an MVP using React.
